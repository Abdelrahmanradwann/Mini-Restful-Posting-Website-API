    3 will post a photo
    3 will get all posts ( he should see only his post )
    same with 1

    3 will accept the firend request 
    1 will get all posts, he should see both posts
    3 will do the same and should still only see his own post

    3 will send a friend request to 1
    1 will accept friend request

    now 3 should be able to see both posts

    user 2 will share a post without media

    2 will send friend request to 1 and same with 1
    both will accept

    2 will get all comments of user 1's post ( should get nothing )
    then 2 will add the first comment to the post

    user 2 will get all posts, should get 2 posts

    3 will get all comments of the post
    3 will like user 2's comment ( check in DB )



    user 4 will sign up and forget his password, so he 'll gonna reset it ( an email should be sent for verification )
    when he resets it, he will search for user 1 ( using his username ) and add a friend request to user 1 and user 1 will accept
