1) nginx setup for load balancing

2) 2 servers for distributing requests on them

3) object store setup 
    for temp storage 
    for permanent storage -> 2 buckets 
        1) vidoes 2) photos & profile pic
        will contain replica for availability if one was down

4) kafka setup for messaging system 
    2 brokers
    broker 1 for vid and broker 2 for images whether profile pic or media
    each broker contains 2 partitions
    2 consumer groups and each group contains 2 consumers cuz we 've 2 partitions and reduce the load
    consumers then send the video to encoding service
    I will try to make encoding service scalable (min 2, max 4)

5) scalability of encoding service or make 3 containers directly to make it easier

6) database mysql master and will replicate to two slaves database instances
